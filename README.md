projectLite.vim
===============

Small utility for project setting I wrote in Vim.
This works by going from currend work dir and finds file named by
.projectLite.vim and sources it.  That simmple.  This is because i have enough
of settings makeprg per different project in vimrc, and I want it set the way I
want and I want it now!
